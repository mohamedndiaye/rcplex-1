* status codes
Several status codes indicate a success of the optimization process

1 ... Simplex/Barrier optimal
101 ... MIP optimal (when n = 1)
128 ... optimal populated (n > 1, all possible solutions have been
   found, may be solutions that are "not optimal" in the sense of
   maximum/minimum - e.g. gap -> Inf) 
129 ... optimal populated tol. (all possible solutions within a
   specified tolerance/gap) 
130 ... optimal populate lim. (n possible solutions, maybe there are
   more than these) 

Is it probably better to return 0 if one of the above status codes are
   encountered and the status code otherwise? Nevertheless, this
   should be mentioned more clearly in the man page of Rcplex.

* column-major order in simple_triplet_matrix

This should be checked in the R side, and corrected if needed to avoid segfaults
