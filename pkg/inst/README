Rcplex -- An R Interface to the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer 

CPLEX is an industrial-strength solver for linear, quadratic and mixed
integer programs.  This interface uses the CPLEX callable library to
create and solve problems of these types.  Problem type is determined
by problem data passed to the Rcplex function.  Many CPLEX parameters
are allowed to be set with functions to set any CPLEX parameter
forthcoming in future versions.

Installation of the Rcplex package REQUIRES a working CPLEX
installation. See the file "INSTALL" for details on how to install the
Rcplex package on Linux/Unix-like and Windows systems.
